# MSP432-communication-project
## Contributors: Veronica Herzog, Blake Hina
This project was created for the Boston University EC450 class. This project allows two TIMSP432 boards to communicate with one another via UART protocol. One player is able to draw an image on their screen, send it, and receive drawings back.
